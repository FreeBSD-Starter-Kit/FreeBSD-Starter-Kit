### FreeBSD Starter Kit

### Purpose: 
To create a better FreeBSD user experience for newcomers.

### Objectives:
* Provide a bootable FreeBSD Starter Kit image which installs FreeBSD with a desktop environment by default to reduce toil.
* Provide a FreeBSD desktop support forum. 
* Provide a GUI application to burn ISO and IMG files to a USB device.
* Provide a boot loader manager that more easily supports bootstrapping of other operating systems.
